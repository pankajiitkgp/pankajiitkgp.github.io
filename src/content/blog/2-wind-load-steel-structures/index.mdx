## Introduction

Steel industry is growing rapidly in almost all parts of the world. Time is most important parameter from the construction point of view and steel structure is built in a short period. Steel structures are more advantageous than that of RC structure, because they have better response (Prakarsh et al, 2015) [1].

<Callout variant="exercise">

Wind pressure and forces on an elevated storage reservoir for water of capacity of 1 lakh litres is to be calculated using code IS-875: 2015 (Part-3) [2] considering steel framed structure.

</Callout>

**Details of the elevated water reservior:**

- For capacity of 1,00,000 litres of water, Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) panel tank of size 6.0 m square by 3.0 m deep is considered.
- A typical steel structure consists of four bays of plan dimensions 4.40 m x 4.40 m and elevation dimensions of one bay is 4.40 m x 4.00 m.
- Structure having overall elevation of 16.0 m (excluding tank).
- Elevation and plan view of the steel tower shown below.

<Callout title="Sectional properties" variant="note">
Consideration for structural members are given below.

| Member             | Section        | Length L, m | Width b, m |
| :----------------: | :------------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| Column member      | ISA 200x200x12 | 4.0         | 0.20       |
| Horizontal member  | ISA 110x110x10 | 4.40        | 0.10       |
| Diagonal bracing   | ISA 90x90x10   | 5.94        | 0.090      |
| Horizontal bracing | ISA 65x65x8    | 6.23        | 0.065      |

</Callout>

**Design parameters:**

- Wind zone: Wind zone-II, Basic wind speed, V<sub>b</sub> = 39 m/s, (IS:875-Part 3, Cl. 6.2, Fig. 1)
- Terrain Category: Terrain Category 3 considering residential area (Cl. 6.3.2.1 (c)).

**Design factors:**

- Risk factor coefficient factor, k<sub>1</sub> = 1.06 considering important buildings (Cl. 6.3.1, Table 1).
- Terrain and height factor, k<sub>2</sub> varies with height (Cl. 6.3.2.2, Table 2).
- Topography factor, k<sub>3</sub> = 1.0, (Cl. 6.3.3.1).
- Importance factor for cyclonic region, k<sub>4</sub> = 1.0, (Cl. 6.3.4).
- Wind directionality factor, K<sub>d</sub> = 0.9, (Cl. 7.1.1).
- Area average factor, (Cl. 7.2.2, Table 4)
  - K<sub>a</sub> = 1.0, for tower portion
  - K<sub>a</sub> = 1.0, for tank portion, as exposed area of tank = 6x3 = 18 m<sup>2</sup>

**Design wind pressure:**

Design wind speed,
$$
   \tag{Cl. 6.3}
   V_z = V_bk_1k_2k_3k_4 = 39*1.06*k_2*1.0*1.0 = 41.34k_2
$$

Wind pressure,
$$
   \tag{Cl. 7.2}
   p_z = 0.6\left(V_z\right)^{\smash{2}}
$$

Design wind pressure,

$$
   \tag{Cl. 7.2}
   p_d = p_zK_dK_a
$$

Variation in design wind speed & pressure with height

| Height from ground, m |  K2  | Vz, m/s | Pz, KN/m2) | Pd, (KN/m2) |          |
| :-------------------: | :--: | :-----: | :--------: | :---------: | :------: |
|           15          | 0.97 |   40.1  |    0.96    |     0.87    | For tank |
|           16          | 0.98 |  40.51  |    0.98    |     0.89    |          |
|           22          | 1.02 |  42.17  |    1.07    |     0.96    |          |
|           15          | 0.97 |   40.1  |    0.96    |     0.87    | For tank |

**Wind load calculations:**

Overall horizontal force on the tank:

$$
F_{tank} = C_fA_ep_d
$$

$$
\begin{gather}
   \tag{Table 20}
   \frac{b}{d} = \frac{6}{6} = 1.0\\
   V_zb = 42.17\ast6 = 253.0 > 10 \\
   \frac{h}{b}= \frac{3}{6} = 0.50\\
   \textmd {hence, }
   C_f = 0.50\\
   F_{tank} = 0.5\ast6\ast3\ast0.96 = 8.64\space kN
\end{gather}
$$

Overall horizontal force on the tower members:

Solidity ratio of a frame,

$$
\Phi = \frac{net\space area}{total\space area}
$$

Total area,

$$
= 4\ast4.4\ast4 = 70.40\space m_2
$$

Net area of the one frame

$$
= 4\ast(4\ast2\ast0.2 + 4.4\ast0.11 + 4\ast2.97\ast0.09) = 12.60\space ùëö2
$$

Solidity ratio of one frame,

$$
\Phi = \frac{12.60}{70.40} = 0.18
$$

Wind forces on the members,

$$
F_{members} = C_f\ast L\ast b\ast p_d
$$

Where, L = length of member, and b = width of the member

The structure is multiple bay frame of steel sections and Cl. 7.4.3.5 with table 33 is applicable for calculation of C<sub>f</sub> and the value is linearly interpolated.

$$
\tag{Table 33}
C_f= 3.41
